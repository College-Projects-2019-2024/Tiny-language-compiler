# Tiny Language Compiler with Scanner and Parser

## Overview

This is a tiny language compiler that includes a scanner and a parser, equipped with a graphical user interface (GUI). The compiler processes source code written in a simple language, providing functionality to tokenize input code and generate parse trees.

## Features

1. **Scanner:** The scanner reads the source code and tokenizes it, identifying individual tokens and their types.

2. **Parser:** The parser takes the tokens generated by the scanner and constructs a parse tree, representing the syntactic structure of the input code.

3. **GUI Interface:** The graphical user interface allows users to interact with the compiler visually. Users can input source code, view generated tokens, and visualize the parse tree.

## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tiny-language-compiler.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd tiny-language-compiler`

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. This may include GUI libraries such as Tkinter, GraphViz or any other specified in the project documentation.

3. **Run the Compiler:**
   - Execute the main application file: `python main.py`
   - The GUI interface will be displayed, allowing you to input source code.

4. **Tokenization:**
   - Click on the "Scan" or "Tokenize" button to initiate the scanning process.
   - View the generated tokens and their types in the designated area of the GUI.

5. **Parsing:**
   - Click on the "Parse" button to initiate the parsing process.
   - Visualize the parse tree in the GUI.


The GUI can display the tokens and parse tree, helping users understand the structure of the code.
